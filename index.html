	<h3>What is the Web?</h3>

	<p>
		The <em>web</em> is short for "The Internet", and is made up of millions of computers
		that all talk to each other. Just like a spider's web. When a person wants to go somewhere on
		the web or searches for something on Google for instance, you start by opening a
		<em>web browser</em> and typing an address like www.google.com to tell your computer
		what you want to do. This sends a <em>HTTP request</em> to another computer called a
		<em>server</em>. The server finds the appropriate <em>HTML document</em> and sends it
		back to your computer. Your web browser interprets the document and displays the
		<em>web page</em> on your computer's screen.
	</p>
	
	<h3>What is a Web Page?</h3>
	<p>
		A <em>web page</em> is a text document written in a language called <em>HTML</em>.
		Web browsers reads these documents, interprets the content, and displays it to you. 
	</p>
	
	<h3>What is HTLM?</h3>
	<p>
		<em>HTML</em> is a collection of documents that lives on these servers, and forms the 
		basis of the web. HTML documents can contain anything - that which <em>you see</em>
		in your browser - and includes special formatting instructions to show <em>how it looks</em>
		in your browser. This is called <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em> and is where
		the name <em>HTML</em> comes from. There is also a special "glue" that holds it all
		together called a <em>hyperlink</em>, a reference or a web address of where to find
		the information you're looking for.
	</p>

	<h3>How does a HTLM document look?</h3>

	<p>
		Just like an English sentence, HTML sentences also have a certain structure, or
		syntax, in order to make sense. A HTML sentence is called an <em>element</em>, and
		starts with a <em>tag</em>, may include <em>attributes</em>, followed by the 
		<em>content</em> of the element, and ends with another <em>tag</em> that is the 
		same as the starting tag and signifies the end of the element. For example:
		"&lt;tag attribute=value&gt; contents &lt;/tag&gt;".
	</p>
	<p>
		Tags are indicated by enclosing them in angled brackets. Attributes have values 
		assigned to them.
	</p>
	
	<p>		
		These HTML elements are laid out in a special way to indicate the structure of a
		document. For instance, the element can indicate that one is working with a "HTML" document,
		with a "head" that identifies the document and includes references to procedures
		and certain styles in which to display the document, and then a "body" section that is the actual
		contents of the document - what it is all about.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		There are many more rules about things like whitespace, void tags, and different uses for inline 
		and block elements.	Fortunately we have an excellent reference in the web itself 
		about HTLM where we can easily look up the syntax. A good place to start is the 
		<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/"> w3schools.com</a> website.
